# Computer Science B.S. Program - Capstone Project

This project was based on the final project completed during my semester of Software Reverse Engineering. This project is the artifact selected for my capstone demonstration of proficiency.

### The proficiency goals for my Computer Science Capstone project were met within the following 3 stages of Artifact enhancements:. 

## Enhancements Stage 1:
The **first stage** of enhancements was a full rewrite and restructuring of the application from the original C++ code into Rust. The goal of the first stage of enhancements was to satisfy the Software Engineering and Design component of my capstone project. 
This first stage included the following source files:
- main.rs
- errors.rs
- firm_models.rs
- util.rs
- menu.rs
  
## Enhancements Stage 2:
The **second stage** of enhancements satisfied the Data Structures and Algorithms components of my final project. 
This stage includes an authorization / login system using Argon2, as well as the local data structures used for program operations. This includes an AVL tree for primary system operations, which is loaded once the application has authenticated login. The system also utilizes HashMaps for the remaining local operations, loaded using a "lazy" caching approach. 
It included the following source files:
- data_structs.rs
- auth.rs

## Enhancements Stage 3:
The **third stage** satisfied the database component of the project. 
In this stage, I built and implemented a full remote database system, and implemented dependency management for the application.
It included the following source files:
- database.rs
- operation_handlers.rs



# Initial Setup:


### The following instructions can be used to build  this project locally.


The following SQL can be used as the initial setup for your own MySQL database, if you would like the secrets / connection data for this project, please feel free to email / reach out to me and they will be provided.

```MySQL

CREATE TABLE employees ( 
employee_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, 
employee_name VARCHAR(75) NOT NULL, 
hashed_password VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL 
); 


CREATE TABLE clients ( 
client_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, 
client_name VARCHAR(75) NOT NULL, 
client_service INT NOT NULL, 
assigned_employee INT, 
FOREIGN KEY (assigned_employee) REFERENCES employees(employee_id) 
);

```

Initially, you will need secrets data that are not provided within this repository in order to establish the database connection. This file is called `config.toml` in the main project directory. 

The `clients_list.csv` file can be used to seed the database with clients once you have seeded the 10 initial employee accounts. I used DBeaver to add the csv file to my database once I had the employees seeded using the function mentioned below. The `clients_list.csv` is also provided in the main directory.

To properly run this application, you will need to provide 10 employee accounts to the following definition in the `initial_employee_setup()` function of `main.rs` main module. You will need a minimum of 10 employee accounts to seed the database with the client-list as it is currently configured.

```Rust

let employees = vec![
//("name1", "password1"),
//("name2", "password2"),
];
    
```

Add additional lines to equal at least 10, and assign the values for the employee name and password. Save and delete this data after the initial seeding process. The passwords will be hashed, and are what you will use to log into a specific employee's account. These accounts are the method by which you will access the system through.

The employees will be assigned employee_id numbers automatically by the database, starting with id # 1.

I will be providing an example config file that can be used with your own database details to build and run the application. Just replace the data in the config.toml file with your own database credentials.

## Getting started: 

I recommend that you use the Docker build/instruction path, as that will handle any dependencies that the project relies on, you will not need to install any additional packages. I say this because I found that at least for my primary computer, running a Debian environment, I needed to have additional dependencies such as "pkg-config" installed in order to build the project from source using the standard local build command for rust "cargo build." If you are on Linux, cargo will let you know if you are missing a dependency, and it is as simple as just executing an install command using your distributionâ€™s package manager, ex: apt install pkg-config. Windows systems should not require any additional steps beyond what is described below. 

# BUILDING WITH DOCKER:

Whether you are on Windows, or on Linux, the first step for this particular path is to install docker. 

### LINUX DOCKER:
For Linux, the most straight forward way is to use the package manager for your distribution, such as apt for Debian/Ubuntu. That command would look like "apt install docker", if you have any issues building the docker file on Linux with just standard docker, I would recommend adding "apt install docker-compose." 
The official docker page for Linux is where I would recommend looking to find the install command for a specific distribution. That can be found here: 

[Install Docker for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

### WINDOWS DOCKER:
For windows, you will need to download a recent version of docker, and then install it. This can be done using Docker's web page here: 

[Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

Docker will ask you to log out / reboot if you are on windows, do so, then proceed on to building.

### BUILDING:
The next step, is to download the source directory. 
Extract the directory, open up a console / terminal emulator of your choice, and then cd into the extracted project directory. 

Once you are in the project directory, for example `/home/user/Documents/SNHU/C4/CS499/FinalProject`, you will then want to execute the following commands in the terminal, while you are in the project directory.

To build the image, run the following command. NOTE: on Linux, you may need to prepend a 'sudo' to each of these commands before execution if you are given an error regarding permissions

```
docker build -t final_project .
```


Once the image has finished building, to start the container / application, use the following command:

```
docker run -it --rm final_project
```

# BUILDING THE PROJECT LOCALLY WITH RUST / CARGO:

The first step will be to download and install rust for your system. 


#### For LINUX/OSX:
This installation is as simple as executing the rustup command from within your terminal: 

The command can be found here:
[Official Rust-lang Installation Instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

and it includes the following curl for installation: 

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### For WINDOWS

The command is similarly easy, download the rust installer from the following page:
[Rust Installation Options](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html)

A direct link to the x86_64 version can be found below.
[x86_64-pc-windows-msvc](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe)

I would recommend using the default installation for both the Linux/OSX and Windows builds. Non-standard installations have not been tested, so there is no guarantee they will operate the same. 


### BUILDING:
Once you have finished the installation, open up your selected console / terminal emulator. 

cd into the main project directory wherever it is downloaded to, ex: `cd /home/user/Documents/SNHU/C4/CS499/FinalProject`.

The following commands are used to build the project on both Windows, and Linux. 

To begin the building process, execute:

```
cargo build
```

When it is finished, you may run the built executable by then running:

```
cargo run
```

You may also directly run the executable that was built in the project directory, but I recommend allowing cargo to handle it. 



#### --- PROCEED TO DOCUMENTATION OR OPERATING THE APPLICATION



### DOCUMENTATION:

If you would like to build the documentation website / pages for the project, execute the following command while cd'd into the main directory for the project ex: `/home/user/Documents/SNHU/C4/CS499/FinalProject`

```
cargo doc
```

On the windows environment I used to test the cross-platform functionality, the following location is where the index page of the project's documentation wikipedia style html-docs are located. You can also open any of the generated document html pages, and use the search bar, along with one of the trait, enum, strucs, etc from the project, and it will provide you with a description as to what the application component is used for, and what options you have when working with it. 

`file:///C:/Users/USERACCOUNT/Desktop/FinalProject/target/doc/final_project/index.html`


An example of these documentation pages for this project can be seen below.

# OPERATING THE APPLICATION:

### FROM THE LOGIN SCREEN: 

The application will then connect to the login screen, at which time you will be able to provide an employee ID and the specific password for the employee of your choice. I have not implemented any user control policies for specific accounts, so they will all have the same access permissions, and will be able to work with the data.

The list of available name and passwords that can be used to log into the system are provided in the main project directory. For my own purposes, I stored these login credentials within the file auth-data.csv. That file is not included in this repo, as it provides authorization to login to the system, but if you would like the credentials, I can provide them on an individual basis. Otherwise, if you are building the project yourself, the authentication details would be the employees that you seeded the database with initially in the `main.rs` file

There are 10 accounts / employees that have client lists assigned to them. Use your selected employee id integer (1-10), and the corresponding password for that id in order to log into the system.

### USING THE SYSTEM:

The application is currently limited to the following actions / interactions:
- You may display a list of all clients assigned to a specific employee, by providing their employee_id,
- You may perform modifications to the services that a client is receiving by providing their client_id, 
- You may change the employee that a client is paired with providing their client & employee id, and 
- You may exit the application. 

### NOTE:
The back end for additional functionality has been implemented, and is working. It is what I used to seed the database with Client/Employee data. These options include adding/removing employee & clients, changing additional client/employee values. But there are currently no menu options available for many of these operations, as I have not yet designed / implemented a user access account control system. 

Support for changing the employee pairing of clients has been added in the updated application version.
